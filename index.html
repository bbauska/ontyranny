<h2>Preamble</h2>
        <article>
<p>History does not repeat, but it does instruct. As the Founding Fathers debated our
Constitution, they took instruction from the history they knew. Concerned that the
democratic republic they envisioned would collapse, they contemplated the descent
of ancient democracies and republics into oligarchy and empire. As they knew,
Aristotle warned that inequality brought instability, while Plato believed that
demagogues exploited free speech to install themselves as tyrants.</p>

<p>In founding a democratic republic upon law and establishing a system of checks and 
balances, the Founding Fathers sought to avoid the evil that they, like the ancient 
philosophers, called tyranny. They had in mind the usurpation of power by a single 
individual or group, or the circumvention of law by rulers for their own benefit.</p>

<p>Much of the succeeding political debate in the United States has concerned the problem 
of tyranny within American society: over slaves and women, for example.
It is thus a primary American tradition to consider history when our political
order seems imperiled. If we worry today that the American experiment is
threatened by tyranny, we can follow the example of the Founding Fathers and
contemplate the history of other democracies and republics. The good news is that
we can draw upon more recent and relevant examples than ancient Greece and
Rome. The bad news is that the history of modern democracy is also one of decline
and fall. Since the American colonies declared their independence from a British
monarchy that the Founders deemed “tyrannical,” European history has seen three
major democratic moments: after the First World War in 1918, after the Second
World War in 1945, and after the end of communism in 1989. Many of the
democracies founded at these junctures failed, in circumstances that in some
important respects resemble our own.</p>

<p>History can familiarize, and it can warn. In the late nineteenth century, just as
in the late twentieth century, the expansion of global trade generated expectations
of progress. In the early twentieth century, as in the early twenty-first, these hopes
were challenged by new visions of mass politics in which a leader or a party
claimed to directly represent the will of the people. European democracies
collapsed into right-wing authoritarianism and fascism in the 1920s and ’30s. The
communist Soviet Union, established in 1922, extended its model into Europe in
the 1940s. The European history of the twentieth century shows us that societies
can break, democracies can fall, ethics can collapse, and ordinary men can find
themselves standing over death pits with guns in their hands. It would serve us well
today to understand why.</p>

<p>Both fascism and communism were responses to globalization: to the real and
perceived inequalities it created, and the apparent helplessness of the democracies
in addressing them. Fascists rejected reason in the name of will, denying objective
truth in favor of a glorious myth articulated by leaders who claimed to give voice to
the people. They put a face on globalization, arguing that its complex challenges
were the result of a conspiracy against the nation. Fascists ruled for a decade or
two, leaving behind an intact intellectual legacy that grows more relevant by the
day. Communists ruled for longer, for nearly seven decades in the Soviet Union,
and more than four decades in much of eastern Europe. They proposed rule by a
disciplined party elite with a monopoly on reason that would guide society toward a
certain future according to supposedly fixed laws of history.</p>

<p>We might be tempted to think that our democratic heritage automatically
protects us from such threats. This is a misguided reflex. In fact, the precedent set
by the Founders demands that we examine history to understand the deep sources
of tyranny, and to consider the proper responses to it. Americans today are no wiser
than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to fascism, Nazism, or communism
in the twentieth century. Our one advantage is that we might learn from their
experience. Now is a good time to do so.</p>

<p>This book presents twenty lessons from the twentieth century, adapted to the
circumstances of today.</p>

              arbitrary or unrestrained exercise of power; despotic abuse of authority.<br>
              A tyrant, in the modern English usage of the word, is an absolute ruler who 
              is unrestrained by law, or one who has usurped a legitimate ruler's 
              sovereignty. Often portrayed as cruel, tyrants may defend their positions 
              by resorting to repressive means. The original Greek term meant an absolute 
              sovereign who came to power without consitutional right, yet the word had a
              neutral connotation during the Archaic and early Classical periods. However,
              Greek philosopher Plato saw tyrannos as a negative form of government, and On
              account of the decisive influence of philosphy on politics, deemed tyranny The
              fourth and worst disorder of a state.

            <dt><strong>In politics, being deceived is no excuse.</strong></dt>
            <dd>—LESZEK KOŁAKOWSKI</dd>
          </dl>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. 
            In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive
            government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked. A citizen 
            who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do.</p>
          <p>Anticipatory obedience is a political tragedy. Perhaps rulers did not initially
            know that citizens were willing to compromise this value or that principle. 
            Perhaps a new regime did not at first have the direct means of influencing 
            citizens one way or another. After the German elections of 1932, which 
            permitted Adolf Hitler to form a government, or the Czechoslovak elections of 
            1946, where communists were victorious, the next crucial step was anticipatory
            obedience. Because enough people in both cases voluntarily extended their 
            services to the new leaders, Nazis and communists alike realized that they 
            could move quickly toward a full regime change. The first heedless acts of 
            conformity could not then be reversed. In early 1938, Adolf Hitler, by then 
            securely in power in Germany, was threatening to annex neighboring Austria. 
            After the Austrian chancellor conceded, it was the Austrians’ anticipatory 
            obedience that decided the fate of Austrian Jews. Local Austrian Nazis 
            captured Jews and forced them to scrub the streets to remove symbols of 
            independent Austria. Crucially, people who were not Nazis looked on with 
            interest and amusement. Nazis who had kept lists of Jewish property stole
            what they could. Crucially, others who were not Nazis joined in the theft. 
            As the political theorist Hannah Arendt remembered, “when German troops 
            invaded the country and Gentile neighbors started riots at Jewish homes, 
            Austrian Jews began to commit suicide.”</p>
          <p>The anticipatory obedience of Austrians in March 1938 taught the high Nazi
            leadership what was possible. It was in Vienna that August that Adolf 
            Eichmann established the Central Office for Jewish Emigration. In November 
            1938, following the Austrian example of March, German Nazis organized the 
            national program known as Kristallnacht.</p>

<p>In 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the SS took the initiative
to devise the methods of mass killing without orders to do so. They guessed what
their superiors wanted and demonstrated what was possible. It was far more than
Hitler had thought.</p>

<p>At the very beginning, anticipatory obedience means adapting instinctively,
without reflecting, to a new situation. Do only Germans do such things? The Yale
psychologist Stanley Milgram, contemplating Nazi atrocities, wanted to show that
there was a particular authoritarian personality that explained why Germans
behaved as they had. He devised an experiment to test the proposition, but failed to
get permission to carry it out in Germany. So he undertook it instead in a Yale
University building in 1961—at around the same time that Adolf Eichmann was
being tried in Jerusalem for his part in the Nazi Holocaust of the Jews.</p>

<p>Milgram told his subjects (some Yale students, some New Haven residents)
that they would be applying an electrical shock to other participants in an
experiment about learning. In fact, the people attached to the wires on the other
side of a window were in on the scheme with Milgram, and only pretended to be
shocked. As the subjects (thought they) shocked the (people they thought were)
participants in a learning experiment, they saw a horrible sight. People whom they
did not know, and against whom they had no grievance, seemed to be suffering
greatly—pounding the glass and complaining of heart pain. Even so, most subjects
followed Milgram’s instructions and continued to apply (what they thought were)
ever greater shocks until the victims appeared to die. Even those who did not
proceed all the way to the (apparent) killing of their fellow human beings left
without inquiring about the health of the other participants.</p>

<p>Milgram grasped that people are remarkably receptive to new rules in a new
setting. They are surprisingly willing to harm and kill others in the service of some
new purpose if they are so instructed by a new authority. “I found so much
obedience,” Milgram remembered, “that I hardly saw the need for taking the
experiment to Germany.”</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">2 Defend institutions.</h2>
        <article>
        <p class="tallFirstLetter">It is institutions that help us to preserve decency. 
          They need our help as well. Do not speak of “our institutions” unless you make
          them yours by acting on their behalf. Institutions do not protect themselves. 
          They fall one after the other unless each is defended from the beginning. So 
          choose an institution you care about—a court, a newspaper, a law, a labor 
          union—and take its side.</p>
        <p>We tend to assume that institutions will automatically maintain themselves
against even the most direct attacks. This was the very mistake that some German
Jews made about Hitler and the Nazis after they had formed a government. On
February 2, 1933, for example, a leading newspaper for German Jews published an
editorial expressing this mislaid trust:</p>

<p>We do not subscribe to the view that Mr. Hitler and his friends, now
finally in possession of the power they have so long desired, will
implement the proposals circulating in [Nazi newspapers]; they will not
suddenly deprive German Jews of their constitutional rights, nor
enclose them in ghettos, nor subject them to the jealous and murderous
impulses of the mob. They cannot do this because a number of crucial
factors hold powers in check…and they clearly do not want to go down
that road. When one acts as a European power, the whole atmosphere
tends towards ethical reflection upon one’s better self and away from
revisiting one’s earlier oppositional posture.</p>

<p>Such was the view of many reasonable people in 1933, just as it is the view of
many reasonable people now. The mistake is to assume that rulers who came to
power through institutions cannot change or destroy those very institutions—even
when that is exactly what they have announced that they will do. Revolutionaries
sometimes do intend to destroy institutions all at once. This was the approach of the
Russian Bolsheviks. Sometimes institutions are deprived of vitality and function,
turned into a simulacrum of what they once were, so that they gird the new order
rather than resisting it. This is what the Nazis called Gleichschaltung.
It took less than a year for the new Nazi order to consolidate. By the end of
1933, Germany had become a one-party state in which all major institutions had
been humbled. That November, German authorities held parliamentary elections
(without opposition) and a referendum (on an issue where the “correct” answer was
known) to confirm the new order. Some German Jews voted as the Nazi leaders
wanted them to in the hope that this gesture of loyalty would bind the new system
to them. That was a vain hope.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">3 Beware the one-party state.</h2>
        <article>
         <p class="tallFirstLetter">The parties that remade states and suppressed rivals were not
omnipotent from the start. They exploited a historic moment to
make political life impossible for their opponents. So support the
multi-party system and defend the rules of democratic elections.
Vote in local and state elections while you can. Consider running for
office.</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson probably never said that “eternal vigilance is the price of
liberty,” but other Americans of his era certainly did. When we think of this saying
today, we imagine our own righteous vigilance directed outward, against misguided
and hostile others. We see ourselves as a city on the hill, a stronghold of
democracy, looking out for threats that come from abroad. But the sense of the
saying was entirely different: that human nature is such that American democracy
must be defended from Americans who would exploit its freedoms to bring about
its end. The American abolitionist Wendell Phillips did in fact say that “eternal
vigilance is the price of liberty.” He added that “the manna of popular liberty must
be gathered each day or it is rotten.”</p>

<p>The record of modern European democracy confirmed the wisdom of those
words. The twentieth century saw earnest attempts to extend the franchise and
establish durable democracies. Yet the democracies that arose after the First World
War (and the Second) often collapsed when a single party seized power in some
combination of an election and a coup d’état. A party emboldened by a favorable
election result or motivated by ideology, or both, might change the system from
within. When fascists or Nazis or communists did well in elections in the 1930s or
’40s, what followed was some combination of spectacle, repression, and salami
tactics—slicing off layers of opposition one by one. Most people were distracted,
some were imprisoned, and others were outmatched.</p>

<p>The hero of a David Lodge novel says that you don’t know, when you make
love for the last time, that you are making love for the last time. Voting is like that.
Some of the Germans who voted for the Nazi Party in 1932 no doubt understood
that this might be the last meaningfully free election for some time, but most did
not. Some of the Czechs and Slovaks who voted for the Czechoslovak Communist
Party in 1946 probably realized that they were voting for the end of democracy, but
most assumed they would have another chance. No doubt the Russians who voted
in 1990 did not think that this would be the last free and fair election in their
country’s history, which (thus far) it has been. Any election can be the last, or at
least the last in the lifetime of the person casting the vote. The Nazis remained in
power until they lost a world war in 1945, the Czechoslovak communists until their
system collapsed in 1989. The Russian oligarchy established after the 1990
elections continues to function, and promotes a foreign policy designed to destroy
democracy elsewhere.</p>

<p>Does the history of tyranny apply to the United States? Certainly the early
Americans who spoke of “eternal vigilance” would have thought so. The logic of
the system they devised was to mitigate the consequences of our real imperfections,
not to celebrate our imaginary perfection. We certainly face, as did the ancient
Greeks, the problem of oligarchy—ever more threatening as globalization increases
differences in wealth. The odd American idea that giving money to political
campaigns is free speech means that the very rich have far more speech, and so in
effect far more voting power, than other citizens. We believe that we have checks
and balances, but have rarely faced a situation like the present: when the less
popular of the two parties controls every lever of power at the federal level, as well
as the majority of statehouses. The party that exercises such control proposes few
policies that are popular with the society at large, and several that are generally
unpopular—and thus must either fear democracy or weaken it.</p>

<p>Another early American proverb held that “where annual elections end,
tyranny begins.” Will we in retrospect see the elections of 2016 much as Russians
see the elections of 1990, or Czechs the elections of 1946, or Germans the
elections of 1932? This, for now, depends upon us. Much needs to be done to fix
the gerrymandered system so that each citizen has one equal vote, and so that each
vote can be simply counted by a fellow citizen. We need paper ballots, because they
cannot be tampered with remotely and can always be recounted. This sort of work
can be done at the local and state levels. We can be sure that the elections of 2018,
assuming they take place, will be a test of American traditions. So there is much to
do in the meantime.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">4. Take responsibility for the face of the world.</h2>
        <article>
         <p class="tallFirstLetter">The symbols of today enable the reality of tomorrow. Notice the
swastikas and the other signs of hate. Do not look away, and do not
get used to them. Remove them yourself and set an example for
others to do so.</p>

<p>Life is political, not because the world cares about how you feel, but because the
world reacts to what you do. The minor choices we make are themselves a kind of
vote, making it more or less likely that free and fair elections will be held in the
future. In the politics of the everyday, our words and gestures, or their absence,
count very much. A few extreme (and less extreme) examples from the twentieth
century can show us how.</p>

<p>In the Soviet Union under the rule of Joseph Stalin, prosperous farmers were
portrayed on propaganda posters as pigs—a dehumanization that in a rural setting
clearly suggests slaughter. This was in the early 1930s, as the Soviet state tried to
master the countryside and extract capital for crash industrialization. The peasants
who had more land or livestock than others were the first to lose what they had. A
neighbor portrayed as a pig is someone whose land you can take. But those who
followed the symbolic logic became victims in their turn. Having turned the poorer
peasants against the richer, Soviet power then seized everyone’s land for the new
collective farms. Collectivization, when completed, brought starvation to much of
the Soviet peasantry. Millions of people in Soviet Ukraine, Soviet Kazakhstan, and
Soviet Russia died horrible and humiliating deaths between 1930 and 1933. Before
it was over, Soviet citizens were butchering corpses for human meat.</p>

<p>In 1933, as the starvation in the USSR reached its height, the Nazi Party came
to power in Germany. In the euphoria of victory, Nazis tried to organize a boycott
of Jewish shops. This was not very successful at first. But the practice of marking
one firm as “Jewish” and another as “Aryan” with paint on the windows or walls did
affect the way Germans thought about household economics. A shop marked
“Jewish” had no future. It became an object of covetous plans. As property was
marked as ethnic, envy transformed ethics. If shops could be “Jewish,” what about
other companies and properties? The wish that Jews might disappear, perhaps
suppressed at first, rose as it was leavened by greed. Thus the Germans who marked
shops as “Jewish” participated in the process by which Jews really did disappear—
as did people who simply looked on. Accepting the markings as a natural part of
the urban landscape was already a compromise with a murderous future.
You might one day be offered the opportunity to display symbols of loyalty.</p>

<p>Make sure that such symbols include your fellow citizens rather than exclude them.
Even the history of lapel pins is far from innocent. In Nazi Germany in 1933,
people wore lapel pins that said “Yes” during the elections and referendum that
confirmed the one-party state. In Austria in 1938, people who had not previously
been Nazis began to wear swastika pins. What might seem like a gesture of pride
can be a source of exclusion. In the Europe of the 1930s and ’40s, some people
chose to wear swastikas, and then others had to wear yellow stars.</p>

<p>The late history of communism, when no one believed in the revolution
anymore, offers a final lesson about symbols. Even when citizens are demoralized
and wish only to be left alone, public markers can still sustain a tyrannical regime.
When Czechoslovak communists won elections in 1946 and then proceeded to
claim full power after a coup in 1948, many Czechoslovak citizens were euphoric.
When the dissident thinker Václav Havel wrote “The Power of the Powerless” three
decades later, in 1978, he was explaining the continuity of an oppressive regime in
whose goals and ideology few people still believed. He offered a parable of a
greengrocer who places a sign reading “Workers of the world, unite!” in his shop
window.</p>

<p>It is not that the man actually endorses the content of this quotation from The
Communist Manifesto. He places the sign in his window so that he can withdraw
into daily life without trouble from the authorities. When everyone else follows the
same logic, the public sphere is covered with signs of loyalty, and resistance
becomes unthinkable. As Havel put it:</p>

<p>We have seen that the real meaning of the greengrocer’s slogan has
nothing to do with what the text of the slogan actually says. Even so,
the real meaning is quite clear and generally comprehensible because
the code is so familiar: the greengrocer declares his loyalty in the only
way the regime is capable of hearing; that is, by accepting the
prescribed ritual, by accepting appearances as reality, by accepting the
given rules of the game, thus making it possible for the game to go on,
for it to exist in the first place.</p>

<p>And what happens, asked Havel, if no one plays the game?</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">5 Remember professional ethics.</h2>
        <article>
<p class="tallFirstLetter">When political leaders set a negative example, professional
commitments to just practice become more important. It is hard to
subvert a rule-of-law state without lawyers, or to hold show trials
without judges. Authoritarians need obedient civil servants, and
concentration camp directors seek businessmen interested in cheap
labor.</p>

<p>Before the Second World War, a man named Hans Frank was Hitler’s personal
lawyer. After Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Frank became the governor-
general of occupied Poland, a German colony where millions of Jews and other
Polish citizens were murdered. He once boasted that there were not enough trees to
make the paper for posters that would be needed to announce all of the executions.
Frank claimed that law was meant to serve the race, and so what seemed good for
the race was therefore the law. With arguments like this, German lawyers could
convince themselves that laws and rules were there to serve their projects of
conquest and destruction, rather than to hinder them.</p>

<p>The man Hitler chose to oversee the annexation of Austria, Arthur Seyss-
Inquart, was a lawyer who later ran the occupation of the Netherlands. Lawyers
were vastly overrepresented among the commanders of the Einsatzgruppen, the
special task forces who carried out the mass murder of Jews, Gypsies, Polish elites,
communists, the handicapped, and others. German (and other) physicians took part
in ghastly medical experiments in the concentration camps. Businessmen from I.G.
Farben and other German firms exploited the labor of concentration camp inmates,
Jews in ghettos, and prisoners of war. Civil servants, from ministers down to
secretaries, oversaw and recorded it all.</p>

<p>If lawyers had followed the norm of no execution without trial, if doctors had
accepted the rule of no surgery without consent, if businessmen had endorsed the
prohibition of slavery, if bureaucrats had refused to handle paperwork involving
murder, then the Nazi regime would have been much harder pressed to carry out
the atrocities by which we remember it.</p>

<p>Professions can create forms of ethical conversation that are impossible
between a lonely individual and a distant government. If members of professions
think of themselves as groups with common interests, with norms and rules that
oblige them at all times, then they can gain confidence and indeed a certain kind of
power. Professional ethics must guide us precisely when we are told that the
situation is exceptional. Then there is no such thing as “just following orders.” If
members of the professions confuse their specific ethics with the emotions of the
moment, however, they can find themselves saying and doing things that they might
previously have thought unimaginable.</p>

          <h2 class="chapter-title">6 Be wary of paramilitaries.</h2>
        <article>
<p class="tallFirstLetter">When the men with guns who have always claimed to be against the
system start wearing uniforms and marching with torches and
pictures of a leader, the end is nigh. When the pro-leader
paramilitary and the official police and military intermingle, the
end has come.</p>

<p>Most governments, most of the time, seek to monopolize violence. If only the
government can legitimately use force, and this use is constrained by law, then the
forms of politics that we take for granted become possible. It is impossible to carry
out democratic elections, try cases at court, design and enforce laws, or indeed
manage any of the other quiet business of government when agencies beyond the
state also have access to violence. For just this reason, people and parties who wish
to undermine democracy and the rule of law create and fund violent organizations
that involve themselves in politics. Such groups can take the form of a paramilitary
wing of a political party, the personal bodyguard of a particular politician—or
apparently spontaneous citizens’ initiatives, which usually turn out to have been
organized by a party or its leader.</p>

<p>Armed groups first degrade a political order, and then transform it. Violent
right-wing groups, such as the Iron Guard in interwar Romania or the Arrow Cross
in interwar Hungary, intimidated their rivals. Nazi storm troopers began as a
security detail clearing the halls of Hitler’s opponents during his rallies. As
paramilitaries known as the SA and the SS, they created a climate of fear that
helped the Nazi Party in the parliamentary elections of 1932 and 1933. In Austria
in 1938 it was the local SA that quickly took advantage of the absence of the usual
local authority to loot, beat, and humiliate Jews, thereby changing the rules of
politics and preparing the way for the Nazi takeover of the country. It was the SS
that ran the German concentration camps—lawless zones where ordinary rules did
not apply. During the Second World War, the SS extended the lawlessness it had
pioneered in the camps to whole European countries under German occupation.
The SS began as an organization outside the law, became an organization that
transcended the law, and ended up as an organization that undid the law.</p>

<p>Because the American federal government uses mercenaries in warfare and
American state governments pay corporations to run prisons, the use of violence in
the United States is already highly privatized. What is novel is a president who
wishes to maintain, while in office, a personal security force which during his
campaign used force against dissenters. As a candidate, the president ordered a
private security detail to clear opponents from rallies, but also encouraged the
audience itself to remove people who expressed different opinions. A protestor
would first be greeted with boos, then with frenetic cries of “USA,” and then be
forced to leave the rally. At one campaign rally the candidate said, “There’s a
remnant left over. Maybe get the remnant out. Get the remnant out.” The crowd,
taking its cue, then tried to root out other people who might be dissenters, all the
while crying “USA.” The candidate interjected: “Isn’t this more fun than a regular
boring rally? To me, it’s fun.” This kind of mob violence was meant to transform
the political atmosphere, and it did.</p>

<p>For violence to transform not just the atmosphere but also the system, the
emotions of rallies and the ideology of exclusion have to be incorporated into the
training of armed guards. These first challenge the police and military, then
penetrate the police and military, and finally transform the police and military.</p>

        <article>
         <p class="tallFirstLetter">If you carry a weapon in public service, may God bless you and
keep you. But know that evils of the past involved policemen and
soldiers finding themselves, one day, doing irregular things. Be
ready to say no.</p>

<p>Authoritarian regimes usually include a special riot police force whose task is to
disperse citizens who seek to protest, and a secret state police force whose
assignments include the murder of dissenters or others designated as enemies. And
indeed we find forces of the latter kind deeply involved in the great atrocities of the
twentieth century, such as the Great Terror in the Soviet Union of 1937–38 and the
Holocaust of European Jews perpetrated by Nazi Germany in 1941–45. Yet we
make a great mistake if we imagine that the Soviet NKVD or the Nazi SS acted
without support. Without the assistance of regular police forces, and sometimes
regular soldiers, they could not have killed on such a large scale.</p>

<p>In the Great Terror in the Soviet Union, NKVD officers recorded 682,691
executions of supposed enemies of the state, most of them peasants or members of
national minorities. Perhaps no organ of violence has ever been more centralized or
better organized than the NKVD of those years. A small number of men carried
out the neck shots, which meant that certain NKVD officers had thousands of
political murders on their consciences. Even so, they could not possibly have
carried out this campaign without the assistance of local police forces, legal
professionals, and civil servants throughout the Soviet Union. The Great Terror
took place during a state of exception that required all policemen to subordinate
themselves to the NKVD and its special tasks. The policemen were not the
principle perpetrators, but they provided the indispensable manpower.</p>

<p>When we think of the Nazi Holocaust of the Jews, we imagine Auschwitz and
mechanized impersonal death. This was a convenient way for Germans to
remember the Holocaust, since they could claim that few of them had known
exactly what had happened behind those gates. In fact, the Holocaust began not in
the death facilities, but over shooting pits in eastern Europe. And indeed some of
the commanders of the Einsatzgruppen, the German task forces that perpetrated
some of the murders, were tried at Nuremberg and later in West German courts.
But even these trials were a kind of minimization of the scale of the crime. Not the
SS commanders alone, but essentially all of the thousands of men who served under
their command were murderers.</p>

<p>And this was just the beginning. Every large-scale shooting action of the 
Holocaust (more than thirty-three thousand Jews murdered outside Kyiv, more than
twenty-eight thousand outside Riga, and on and on) involved the regular German
police. All in all, regular policemen murdered more Jews than the Einsatzgruppen.
Many of them had no special preparation for this task. They found themselves in an
unknown land, they had their orders, and they did not want to look weak. In the
rare cases when they refused these orders to murder Jews, policemen were not
punished.</p>

<p>Some killed from murderous conviction. But many others who killed were just
afraid to stand out. Other forces were at work besides conformism. But without the
conformists, the great atrocities would have been impossible.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Someone has to. It is easy to follow along. It can 
            feel strange to do or say something different. But without that unease, there 
            is no freedom. Remember Rosa Parks. The moment you set an example, the spell 
            of the status quo is broken, and others will follow.</p>
          <p>After the Second World War, Europeans, Americans, and others created myths
            of righteous resistance to Hitler. In the 1930s, however, the dominant attitudes 
            had been accommodation and admiration. By 1940 most Europeans had made their 
            peace with the seemingly irresistible power of Nazi Germany. Influential 
            Americans such as Charles Lindbergh opposed war with the Nazis under the slogan 
            “America First.” It is those who were considered exceptional, eccentric, or even 
            insane in their own time—those who did not change when the world around them 
            did—whom we remember and admire today.</p>

<p>Well before the Second World War, numerous European states had abandoned
democracy for some form of right-wing authoritarianism. Italy became the first
fascist state in 1922, and was a military ally of Germany. Hungary, Romania, and
Bulgaria had been drawn toward Germany by the promise of trade and territory. In
March 1938 none of the great powers offered any resistance as Germany annexed
Austria. In September 1938 the great powers—France, Italy, and Great Britain,
then led by Neville Chamberlain—actually cooperated with Nazi Germany in the
partition of Czechoslovakia. In summer 1939 the Soviet Union allied with Nazi
Germany and the Red Army joined the Wehrmacht in the invasion of Poland. The
Polish government chose to fight, activating agreements that brought Great Britain
and France into the war. Germany, supplied with food and fuel by the Soviet
Union, invaded and quickly occupied Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and even
France in the spring of 1940. The remainder of the British expeditionary force was
evacuated from the Continent at Dunkirk in late May and early June 1940.</p>

<p>When Winston Churchill became prime minister in May 1940, Great Britain
was alone. The British had won no meaningful battles and had no important allies.
They had entered the war to support Poland, a cause that seemed lost. Nazi
Germany and its Soviet ally dominated the continent. The Soviet Union had
invaded Finland in November 1939, beginning with a bombing of Helsinki. Right
after Churchill assumed office, the Soviet Union occupied and annexed the three
Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The United States had not entered
the war.

<p>Adolf Hitler had no special animus toward Britain or its empire, and indeed
imagined a division of the world into spheres of interests. He expected Churchill to
come to terms after the fall of France. Churchill did not. He told the French that
“whatever you may do, we shall fight on for ever and ever and ever.”</p>

<p>In June 1940, Churchill told the British parliament that “the battle of Britain
is about to begin.” The German Luftwaffe began the bombing of British cities.
Hitler expected that this would force Churchill to sign an armistice, but he was
mistaken. Churchill later called the air campaign “a time when it was equally good
to live or die.” He spoke of “the buoyant and imperturbable temper of Britain
which I had the honor to express.” In fact he himself helped the British to define
themselves as a proud people who would calmly resist evil. Other politicians would
have found support in British public opinion to end the war. Churchill instead
resisted, inspired, and won. The Royal Air Force (including two Polish squadrons
and a number of other foreign pilots) held back the Luftwaffe. Without control of
the air, even Hitler could not imagine an amphibious invasion of Great Britain.
Churchill did what others had not done. Rather than concede in advance, he
forced Hitler to change his plans. The essential German strategy had been to
remove any resistance in the west, and then to invade (thus betraying) the Soviet
Union and colonize its western territories. In June 1941, with Britain still in the
war, Germany attacked its Soviet ally.</p>

<p>Now Berlin had to fight a two-front war, and Moscow and London were
suddenly unexpected allies. In December 1941, Japan bombed the American naval
base at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, and the United States entered the war. Now
Moscow, Washington, and London formed a grand and irresistible coalition.
Together, and with the help of many other allies, these three great powers won the
Second World War. But had Churchill not kept Britain in the war in 1940, there
would have been no such war to fight.</p>

<p>Churchill said that history would be kind to him, because he intended to write
it himself. Yet in his vast histories and memoirs, he presented his own decisions as
self-evident, and credited the British people and Britain’s allies. Today what
Churchill did seems normal, and right. But at the time he had to stand out.
Of course, Great Britain was only in the war because the Polish leadership had
chosen to fight in September 1939. Open Polish armed resistance was overcome
that October. In 1940, the character of the German occupation was becoming clear
in the Polish capital, Warsaw.</p>

<p>Teresa Prekerowa was meant to finish high school that year. Her family lost its
property to the Germans and was forced to move to Warsaw and rent. Her father
was arrested. One of her uncles was killed in battle. Two of her brothers were in
German prisoner-of-war camps. Warsaw itself had been heavily damaged by a
German air campaign, which had killed about twenty-five thousand people.
Teresa, a very young woman, stood out among her friends and family in her
reaction to this horror. At a time when it was natural to think only of oneself, she
thought of others. In late 1940, the Germans began to establish ghettos in the part
of Poland under their control. That October, the Jews of Warsaw and the
surrounding region were required to move to a certain district of the city. One of
Teresa’s brothers had been friendly with a Jewish girl and her family before the
war. Teresa now observed that people quietly allowed their Jewish friends to slip
away from their lives.</p>

<p>Without telling her family, and at great risk to herself, Teresa chose to enter
the Warsaw ghetto a dozen times in late 1940, bringing food and medicine to Jews
she knew and Jews she did not. By the end of the year she had persuaded her
brother’s friend to escape the ghetto. In 1942 Teresa helped the girl’s parents and
brother to escape. That summer in the Warsaw ghetto, the Germans carried out
what they called the “Great Action,” deporting some 265,040 Jews to the death
factory at Treblinka to be murdered and killing another 10,380 Jews in the ghetto
itself. Teresa saved a family from certain death.</p>

<p>Teresa Prekerowa later became a historian of the Holocaust, writing about the
Warsaw ghetto and about others who helped to aid Jews. But she preferred not to
write about herself. When, much later, she was asked to speak about her own life,
she called her actions normal. From our perspective, her actions seem exceptional.
She stood out.</p>

        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does. 
            Think up your own way of speaking, even if only to convey that thing you 
            think everyone is saying. Make an effort to separate yourself from the 
            internet. Read books.</p>
          <p>Victor Klemperer, a literary scholar of Jewish origin, turned his philological 
            training against Nazi propaganda. He noticed how Hitler’s language rejected 
            legitimate opposition: The people always meant some people and not others (the 
            president uses the word in this way), encounters were always struggles (the 
            president says winning), and any attempt by free people to understand the 
            world in a different way was defamation of the leader (or, as the president 
            puts it, libel).</p>

<p>Politicians in our times feed their clichés to television, where even those who
wish to disagree repeat them. Television purports to challenge political language by
conveying images, but the succession from one frame to another can hinder a sense
of resolution. Everything happens fast, but nothing actually happens. Each story on
televised news is “breaking” until it is displaced by the next one. So we are hit by
wave upon wave but never see the ocean.</p>

<p>The effort to define the shape and significance of events requires words and
concepts that elude us when we are entranced by visual stimuli. Watching televised
news is sometimes little more than looking at someone who is also looking at a
picture. We take this collective trance to be normal. We have slowly fallen into it.
More than half a century ago, the classic novels of totalitarianism warned of
the domination of screens, the suppression of books, the narrowing of vocabularies,
and the associated difficulties of thought. In Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451,
published in 1953, firemen find and burn books while most citizens watch
interactive television. In George Orwell’s 1984, published in 1949, books are
banned and television is two-way, allowing the government to observe citizens at all
times. In 1984, the language of visual media is highly constrained, to starve the
public of the concepts needed to think about the present, remember the past, and
consider the future. One of the regime’s projects is to limit the language further by
eliminating ever more words with each edition of the official dictionary.
Staring at screens is perhaps unavoidable, but the two-dimensional world
makes little sense unless we can draw upon a mental armory that we have
developed somewhere else.</p>

<p>When we repeat the same words and phrases that
appear in the daily media, we accept the absence of a larger framework. To have
such a framework requires more concepts, and having more concepts requires
reading. So get the screens out of your room and surround yourself with books.
The characters in Orwell’s and Bradbury’s books could not do this—but we still
can.</p>

<p>What to read? Any good novel enlivens our ability to think about ambiguous
situations and judge the intentions of others. Fyodor Dostoevsky’s The Brothers
Karamazov and Milan Kundera’s The Unbearable Lightness of Being might suit our
moment. Sinclair Lewis’s novel It Can’t Happen Here is perhaps not a great work of
art; Philip Roth’s The Plot Against America is better. One novel known by millions
of young Americans that offers an account of tyranny and resistance is J. K.
Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. If you or your friends or your
children did not read it that way the first time, then it bears reading again.
Some of the political and historical texts that inform the arguments made here
are “Politics and the English Language” by George Orwell (1946); "The Language of
the Third Reich" by Victor Klemperer (1947); "The Origins of Totalitarianism" by
Hannah Arendt (1951); "The Rebel" by Albert Camus (1951); "The Captive Mind" by
Czesław Miłosz (1953); “The Power of the Powerless” by Václav Havel (1978);
“How to Be a Conservative-Liberal-Socialist” by Leszek Kołakowski (1978); "The
Uses of Adversity" by Timothy Garton Ash (1989); "The Burden of Responsibility" by
Tony Judt (1998); "Ordinary Men" by Christopher Browning (1992); and "Nothing Is
True and Everything Is Possible" by Peter Pomerantsev (2014).</p>

<p>Christians might return to the foundational book, which as ever is very timely.
Jesus preached that it “is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than
for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.” We should be modest, for
“whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that shall humble himself
shall be exalted.” And of course we must be concerned with what is true and what
is false: “And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”</p>

            the collapse of any political system that depends upon individualism. As 
            observers of totalitarianism such as Victor Klemperer noticed, truth dies in 
            four modes, all of which we have just witnessed.</p>
          <p>The first mode is the open hostility to verifiable reality, which takes the 
            form of presenting inventions and lies as if they were facts. The president

            campaign to track his utterances found that 78 percent of his factual claims 
            were false. This proportion is so high that it makes the correct assertions 
            seem like unintended oversights on the path toward total fiction. Demeaning 
            the world as it is begins the creation of a fictional counterworld.</p>
          <p>The second mode is shamanistic incantation. As Klemperer noted, the fascist 
            style depends upon “endless repetition,” designed to make the fictional plausible 
            and the criminal desirable. The systematic use of nicknames such as “Lyin’ Ted” 
            and “Crooked Hillary” displaced certain character traits that might more 
            appropriately have been affixed to the president himself. Yet through blunt 
            repetition over Twitter, our president managed the transformation of individuals 
            into stereotypes that people then spoke aloud. At rallies, the repeated chants 
            of “Build that wall” and “Lock her up” did not describe anything that the 
            president had specific plans to do, but their very grandiosity established a 
            connection between him and his audience.</p>
          <p>The next mode is magical thinking, or the open embrace of contradiction. The 
            president’s campaign involved the promises of cutting taxes for everyone, 
            eliminating the national debt, and increasing spending on both social policy 
            and national defense. These promises mutually contradict. It is as if a farmer 
            said he were taking an egg from the henhouse, boiling it whole and serving it 
            to his wife, and also poaching it and serving it to his children, and then 
            returning it to the hen unbroken, and then watching as the chick hatches.</p>
          <p>Accepting untruth of this radical kind requires a blatant abandonment of 
            reason. Klemperer’s descriptions of losing friends in Germany in 1933 over the 
            issue of magical thinking ring eerily true today. One of his former students 
            implored him to “abandon yourself to your feelings, and you must always focus 
            on the Führer’s greatness, rather than on the discomfort you are feeling at 
            present.” Twelve years later, after all the atrocities, and at the end of a 
            war that Germany had clearly lost, an amputated soldier told Klemperer that 
            Hitler “has never lied yet. I believe in Hitler.”</p>

<p>The final mode is misplaced faith. It involves the sort of self-deifying claims
the president made when he said that “I alone can solve it” or “I am your voice.”
When faith descends from heaven to earth in this way, no room remains for the
small truths of our individual discernment and experience. What terrified
Klemperer was the way that this transition seemed permanent. Once truth had
become oracular rather than factual, evidence was irrelevant. At the end of the war
a worker told Klemperer that “understanding is useless, you have to have faith. I
believe in the Führer.”</p>

<p>Eugène Ionesco, the great Romanian playwright, watched one friend after
another slip away into the language of fascism in the 1930s. The experience
became the basis for his 1959 absurdist play, Rhinoceros, in which those who fall
prey to propaganda are transformed into giant horned beasts. Of his own personal
experiences Ionesco wrote:</p>

<p>University professors, students, intellectuals were turning Nazi,
becoming Iron Guards, one after the other. At the beginning, certainly
they were not Nazis. About fifteen of us would get together to talk and
to try to find arguments opposing theirs. It was not easy….From time to
time, one of our friends said: “I don’t agree with them, to be sure, but
on certain points, nevertheless, I must admit, for example, the Jews…,”
etc. And this was a symptom. Three weeks later, this person would
become a Nazi. He was caught in the mechanism, he accepted
everything, he became a rhinoceros. Towards the end, only three or
four of us were still resisting.</p>

<p>Ionesco’s aim was to help us see just how bizarre propaganda actually is, but
how normal it seems to those who yield to it. By using the absurd image of the
rhinoceros, Ionesco was trying to shock people into noticing the strangeness of
what was actually happening.</p>

<p>The rhinoceri are roaming through our neurological savannahs. We now find
ourselves very much concerned with something we call “post-truth,” and we tend to
think that its scorn of everyday facts and its construction of alternative realities is
something new or postmodern. Yet there is little here that George Orwell did not
capture seven decades ago in his notion of “doublethink.” In its philosophy, post-
truth restores precisely the fascist attitude to truth—and that is why nothing in our
own world would startle Klemperer or Ionesco.</p>

<p>Fascists despised the small truths of daily existence, loved slogans that
resonated like a new religion, and preferred creative myths to history or journalism.
They used new media, which at the time was radio, to create a drumbeat of
propaganda that aroused feelings before people had time to ascertain facts. And
now, as then, many people confused faith in a hugely flawed leader with the truth
about the world we all share.
Post-truth is pre-fascism.</p>

        <h2 class="chapter-title">11 Investigate.</h2>
        <article>
         <p class="tallFirstLetter">Figure things out for yourself. Spend more time with 
           long articles. Subsidize investigative journalism by subscribing to print media. 
           Realize that some of what is on the internet is there to harm you. Learn about 
           sites that investigate propaganda campaigns (some of which come from abroad). 
           Take responsibility for what you communicate with others.</p>

<p>“What is truth?” Sometimes people ask this question because they wish to
do nothing. Generic cynicism makes us feel hip and alternative even as we slip
along with our fellow citizens into a morass of indifference. It is your ability to
discern facts that makes you an individual, and our collective trust in common
knowledge that makes us a society. The individual who investigates is also the
citizen who builds. The leader who dislikes the investigators is a potential tyrant.</p>

<p>During his campaign, the president claimed on a Russian propaganda outlet
that American “media has been unbelievably dishonest.” He banned many reporters
from his rallies, and regularly elicited hatred of journalists from the public. Like
the leaders of authoritarian regimes, he promised to suppress freedom of speech by
laws that would prevent criticism. Like Hitler, the president used the word lies to
mean statements of fact not to his liking, and presented journalism as a campaign
against himself. The president was on friendlier terms with the internet, his source
for erroneous information that he passed on to millions of people.</p>

<p>In 1971, contemplating the lies told in the United States about the Vietnam
War, the political theorist Hannah Arendt took comfort in the inherent power of
facts to overcome falsehoods in a free society: “Under normal circumstances the
liar is defeated by reality, for which there is no substitute; no matter how large the
tissue of falsehood that an experienced liar has to offer, it will never be large
enough, even if he enlists the help of computers, to cover the immensity of
factuality.” The part about computers is no longer true.</p>

<p>In the 2016 presidential
election, the two-dimensional world of the internet was more important than the
three-dimensional world of human contact. People going door-to-door to canvass
encountered the surprised blinking of American citizens who realized that they
would have to talk about politics with a flesh-and-blood human being rather than
having their views affirmed by their Facebook feeds. Within the two-dimensional
internet world, new collectivities have arisen, invisible by the light of day—tribes
with distinct worldviews, beholden to manipulations. (And yes, there is a conspiracy
that you can find online: It is the one to keep you online, looking for conspiracies.)</p>

<p>We need print journalists so that stories can develop on the page and in our
minds. What does it mean, for example, that the president says that women belong
“at home,” that pregnancy is an “inconvenience,” that mothers do not give “100
percent” at work, that women should be punished for having abortions, that women
are “slobs,” “pigs,” or “dogs,” and that it is permissible to sexually assault them?
What does it mean that six of the president’s companies have gone bankrupt, and
that the president’s enterprises have been financed by mysterious infusions of cash
from entities in Russia and Kazakhstan? We can learn these things on various
media. When we learn them from a screen, however, we tend to be drawn in by the
logic of spectacle. When we learn of one scandal, it whets our appetite for the next.</p>

<p>Once we subliminally accept that we are watching a reality show rather than
thinking about real life, no image can actually hurt the president politically. Reality
television must become more dramatic with each episode. If we found a video of
the president performing Cossack dances while Vladimir Putin claps, we would
probably just demand the same thing with the president wearing a bear suit and
holding rubles in his mouth.</p>

<p>The better print journalists allow us to consider the meaning, for ourselves and
our country, of what might otherwise seem to be isolated bits of information. But
while anyone can repost an article, researching and writing is hard work that
requires time and money. Before you deride the “mainstream media,” note that it is
no longer the mainstream. It is derision that is mainstream and easy, and actual
journalism that is edgy and difficult. So try for yourself to write a proper article,
involving work in the real world: traveling, interviewing, maintaining relationships
with sources, researching in written records, verifying everything, writing and
revising drafts, all on a tight and unforgiving schedule. If you find you like doing
this, keep a blog. In the meantime, give credit to those who do all of that for a
living. Journalists are not perfect, any more than people in other vocations are
perfect. But the work of people who adhere to journalistic ethics is of a different
quality than the work of those who do not.</p>

<p>We find it natural that we pay for a plumber or a mechanic, but demand our
news for free. If we did not pay for plumbing or auto repair, we would not expect to
drink water or drive cars. Why then should we form our political judgment on the
basis of zero investment? We get what we pay for.</p>

<p>If we do pursue the facts, the internet gives us enviable power to convey them.
The authorities cited here had nothing of the kind. Leszek Kołakowski, the great
Polish philosopher and historian from whom this book takes its epigraph, lost his
chair at Warsaw University for speaking out against the communist regime, and
could not publish. The first quotation in this book, from Hannah Arendt, came from
a pamphlet entitled “We Refugees,” a miraculous achievement written by someone
who had escaped a murderous Nazi regime. A brilliant mind like Victor
Klemperer, much admired today, is remembered only because he stubbornly kept a
hidden diary under Nazi rule. For him it was sustenance: “My diary was my
balancing pole, without which I would have fallen down a thousand times.” Václav
Havel, the most important thinker among the communist dissidents of the 1970s,
dedicated his most important essay, “The Power of the Powerless,” to a philosopher
who died shortly after interrogation by the Czechoslovak communist secret police.
In communist Czechoslovakia, this pamphlet had to be circulated illegally, in a few
copies, as what east Europeans at the time, following the Russian dissidents, called
“samizdat.”</p>

<p>“If the main pillar of the system is living a lie,” wrote Havel, “then it is not
surprising that the fundamental threat to it is living in truth.” Since in the age of the
internet we are all publishers, each of us bears some private responsibility for the
public’s sense of truth. If we are serious about seeking the facts, we can each make
a small revolution in the way the internet works. If you are verifying information
for yourself, you will not send on fake news to others. If you choose to follow
reporters whom you have reason to trust, you can also transmit what they have
learned to others. If you retweet only the work of humans who have followed
journalistic protocols, you are less likely to debase your brain interacting with bots
and trolls.</p>

<p>We do not see the minds that we hurt when we publish falsehoods, but that
does not mean we do no harm. Think of driving a car. We may not see the other
driver, but we know not to run into his car. We know that the damage will be
mutual. We protect the other person without seeing him, dozens of times every day.
Likewise, although we may not see the other person in front of his or her computer,
we have our share of responsibility for what he or she is reading there. If we can
avoid doing violence to the minds of unseen others on the internet, others will learn
to do the same. And then perhaps our internet traffic will cease to look like one
great, bloody accident.</p>

<p>Tyrannical regimes arose at different times and places in the Europe of the
twentieth century, but memoirs of their victims all share a single tender moment.
Whether the recollection is of fascist Italy in the 1920s, of Nazi Germany of the
1930s, of the Soviet Union during the Great Terror of 1937–38, or of the purges in
communist eastern Europe in the 1940s and ’50s, people who were living in fear of
repression remembered how their neighbors treated them. A smile, a handshake, or
a word of greeting—banal gestures in a normal situation—took on great
significance. When friends, colleagues, and acquaintances looked away or crossed
the street to avoid contact, fear grew. You might not be sure, today or tomorrow,
who feels threatened in the United States. But if you affirm everyone, you can be
sure that certain people will feel better.</p>

<p>In the most dangerous of times, those who escape and survive generally know
people whom they can trust. Having old friends is the politics of last resort. And
making new ones is the first step toward change.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Power wants your body softening in your chair and 
		    your emotions dissipating on the screen. Get outside. Put your body in 
		    unfamiliar places with unfamiliar people. Make new friends and march with 
		    them.</p>

<p>For resistance to succeed, two boundaries must be crossed. First, ideas about
change must engage people of various backgrounds who do not agree about
everything. Second, people must find themselves in places that are not their homes,
and among groups who were not previously their friends. Protest can be organized
through social media, but nothing is real that does not end on the streets. If tyrants
feel no consequences for their actions in the three-dimensional world, nothing will
change.</p>

<p>The one example of successful resistance to communism was the Solidarity
labor movement in Poland in 1980–81: a coalition of workers and professionals,
elements of the Roman Catholic Church, and secular groups. Its leaders had
learned hard lessons under communism. In 1968, the regime mobilized workers
against students who protested. In 1970, when a strike in Gdańsk on the Baltic
coast was bloodily suppressed, it was the workers’ turn to feel isolated. In 1976,
however, intellectuals and professionals formed a group to assist workers who had
been abused by the government. These were people from both the Right and the
Left, believers and atheists, who created trust among workers—people whom they
would not otherwise have met.</p>

<p>When Polish workers on the Baltic coast went on strike again in 1980, they
were joined by lawyers, scholars, and others who helped them make their case. The
result was the creation of a free labor union, as well as government guarantees to
observe human rights. During the sixteen months that Solidarity was legal, ten
million people joined, and countless new friendships were created amid strikes,
marches, and demonstrations. The Polish communist regime put down the
movement with martial law in 1981. Yet eight years later, in 1989, when they
needed negotiating partners, the communists had to turn to Solidarity. The labor
union insisted on elections, which it then won. This was the beginning of the end of
communism in Poland, eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The choice to be in public depends on the ability to maintain a private sphere
of life. We are free only when it is we ourselves who draw the line between when
we are seen and when we are not seen.</p>

		    resolve any legal trouble. Tyrants seek the hook on which to hang you. Try not 
		    to have hooks.</p>
        <p>What the great political thinker Hannah Arendt meant by totalitarianism was
not an all-powerful state, but the erasure of the difference between private and
public life. We are free only insofar as we exercise control over what people know
about us, and in what circumstances they come to know it. During the campaign of
2016, we took a step toward totalitarianism without even noticing by accepting as
normal the violation of electronic privacy. Whether it is done by American or
Russian intelligence agencies, or for that matter by any institution, the theft,
discussion, or publication of personal communications destroys a basic foundation
of our rights. If we have no control over who reads what and when, we have no
ability to act in the present or plan for the future. Whoever can pierce your privacy
can humiliate you and disrupt your relationships at will. No one (except perhaps a
tyrant) has a private life that can survive public exposure by hostile directive.</p>

<p>The timed email bombs of the 2016 presidential campaign were also a
powerful form of disinformation. Words written in one situation make sense only in
that context. The very act of removing them from their historical moment and
dropping them in another is an act of falsification. What is worse, when media
followed the email bombs as if they were news, they betrayed their own mission.</p>

<p>Few journalists made an effort to explain why people said or wrote the things they
did at the time. Meanwhile, in transmitting the privacy violations as news, the
media allowed themselves to be distracted from the actual events of the day. Rather
than reporting the violation of basic rights, our media generally preferred to
mindlessly indulge the inherently salacious interest we have in other people’s affairs.
Our appetite for the secret, thought Arendt, is dangerously political.</p>

<p>Totalitarianism removes the difference between private and public not just to make
individuals unfree, but also to draw the whole society away from normal politics
and toward conspiracy theories. Rather than defining facts or generating
interpretations, we are seduced by the notion of hidden realities and dark
conspiracies that explain everything. As we learned from these email bombs, this
mechanism works even when what is revealed is of no interest. The revelation of
what was once confidential becomes the story itself. (It is striking that news media
are much worse at this than, say, fashion or sports reporters. Fashion reporters
know that models are taking off their clothes in the changing rooms, and sports
reporters know that athletes shower in the locker room, but neither allow private
matters to supplant the public story they are supposed to be covering.)</p>

<p>When we take an active interest in matters of doubtful relevance at moments
that are chosen by tyrants and spooks, we participate in the demolition of our own
political order. To be sure, we might feel that we are doing nothing more than going
along with everyone else. This is true—and it is what Arendt described as the
devolution of a society into a “mob.” We can try to solve this problem individually,
by securing our own computers; we can also try to solve it collectively, by
supporting, for example, organizations that are concerned with human rights.</p>

			to do good.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to know that, whatever the course of events, you are helping others
to do good. Many of us can afford to support some part of the vast network of
charities that one of our former presidents called “a thousand points of light.”
Those points of light are best seen, like stars at dusk, against a darkening sky.
When Americans think of freedom, we usually imagine a contest between a
lone individual and a powerful government. We tend to conclude that the individual
should be empowered and the government kept at bay. This is all well and good.
But one element of freedom is the choice of associates, and one defense of freedom
is the activity of groups to sustain their members. This is why we should engage in
activities that are of interest to us, our friends, our families. These need not be
expressly political: Václav Havel, the Czech dissident thinker, gave the example of
brewing good beer.</p>

<p>Insofar as we take pride in these activities, and come to know others who do
so as well, we are creating civil society. Sharing in an undertaking teaches us that
we can trust people beyond a narrow circle of friends and families, and helps us to
recognize authorities from whom we can learn. The capacity for trust and learning
can make life seem less chaotic and mysterious, and democratic politics more
plausible and attractive.</p>

<p>The anticommunist dissidents of eastern Europe, facing a situation more
extreme than ours, recognized the seemingly nonpolitical activity of civil society as
an expression and a safeguard of freedom. They were right. In the twentieth
century, all the major enemies of freedom were hostile to non-governmental
organizations, charities, and the like. Communists required all such groups to be
officially registered and transformed them into institutions of control. Fascists
created what they called a “corporatist” system, in which every human activity had
its proper place, subordinated to the party-state. Today’s authoritarians (in India,
Turkey, Russia) are also highly allergic to the idea of free associations and non-
governmental organizations.</p>

<p>In the year before the president was elected, American journalists were often
mistaken about his campaign. As he surmounted barrier after barrier and
accumulated victory after victory, our commentariat assured us that at the next
stage he would be stopped by one fine American institution or another. There was,
meanwhile, one group of observers who took a different position: east Europeans
and those who study eastern Europe. To them, much about the president’s
campaign was familiar, and the final outcome was no surprise. Ukrainian and
Russian journalists who sniffed the air in the Midwest said more realistic things
than American pollsters who had built careers on understanding the politics of their
own country.</p>

<p>To Ukrainians, Americans seemed comically slow to react to the obvious
threats of cyberwar and fake news. When Russian propaganda made Ukraine a
target in 2013, young Ukrainian journalists and others reacted immediately,
decisively, and sometimes humorously with campaigns to expose disinformation.
Russia deployed many of the same techniques against Ukraine that it later used
against the United States—while invading Ukraine. When Russian media falsely
claimed in 2014 that Ukrainian troops crucified a small boy, the Ukrainian
response was rapid and effective (at least within Ukraine itself). When Russian
media spread the story in 2016 that Hillary Clinton was ill because she mentioned
an article on “decision fatigue” (which is not an illness) in an email, the story was
spread by Americans. The Ukrainians won, and the Americans lost, in the sense
that Russia failed to get the regime it wanted in its neighbor, but did see its
preferred candidate triumph in the United States. This should give us pause.
History, which for a time seemed to be running from west to east, now seems to be
moving from east to west. Everything that happens here seems to happen there first.</p>

<p>The fact that most Americans do not have passports has become a problem for
American democracy. Sometimes Americans say that they do not need travel
documents, because they prefer to die defending freedom in America. These are
fine words, but they miss an important point. The fight will be a long one. Even if it
does require sacrifice, it first demands sustained attention to the world around us, so
that we know what we are resisting, and how best to do so. So having a passport is
not a sign of surrender. On the contrary, it is liberating, since it creates the
possibility of new experiences. It allows us to see how other people, sometimes
wiser than we, react to similar problems. Since so much of what has happened in
the last year is familiar to the rest of the world or from recent history, we must
observe and listen.</p>

        <article>
          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Be alert to the use of the words extremism and 
		    terrorism. Be alive to the fatal notions of emergency and exception. Be angry 
			about the treacherous use of patriotic vocabulary.</p>

<p>The most intelligent of the Nazis, the legal theorist Carl Schmitt, explained in
clear language the essence of fascist governance. The way to destroy all rules, he
explained, was to focus on the idea of the exception. A Nazi leader outmaneuvers
his opponents by manufacturing a general conviction that the present moment is
exceptional, and then transforming that state of exception into a permanent
emergency. Citizens then trade real freedom for fake safety.</p>

<p>When politicians today invoke terrorism they are speaking, of course, of an
actual danger. But when they try to train us to surrender freedom in the name of
safety, we should be on our guard. There is no necessary tradeoff between the two.
Sometimes we do indeed gain one by losing the other, and sometimes not. People
who assure you that you can only gain security at the price of liberty usually want to
deny you both.</p>

<p>You can certainly concede freedom without becoming more secure. The
feeling of submission to authority might be comforting, but it is not the same thing
as actual safety. Likewise, gaining a bit of freedom may be unnerving, but this
momentary unease is not dangerous. It is easy to imagine situations where we
sacrifice both freedom and safety at the same time: when we enter an abusive
relationship or vote for a fascist. Similarly, it is none too difficult to imagine choices
that increase both freedom and safety, like leaving an abusive relationship or
emigrating from a fascist state. It is the government’s job to increase both freedom
and security.</p>

<p>Extremism certainly sounds bad, and governments often try to make it sound
worse by using the word terrorism in the same sentence. But the word has little
meaning. There is no doctrine called extremism. When tyrants speak of extremists,
they just mean people who are not in the mainstream—as the tyrants themselves
are defining that mainstream at that particular moment. Dissidents of the twentieth
century, whether they were resisting fascism or communism, were called extremists.
Modern authoritarian regimes, such as Russia, use laws on extremism to punish
those who criticize their policies. In this way the notion of extremism comes to
mean virtually everything except what is, in fact, extreme: tyranny.</p>

			“preventively detained” by the police. On the strength of Hitler’s claim that 
			the fire was the work of Germany’s enemies, the Nazi Party won a decisive 
			victory in parliamentary elections on March 5. The police and the Nazi 
			paramilitaries began to round up members of left-wing political parties and 
			place them in improvised concentration camps. On March 23 the new parliament 
			passed an “enabling act,” which allowed Hitler to rule by decree. Germany then 
			remained in a state of emergency for the next twelve years, until the end of 
			the Second World War. Hitler had used an act of terror, an event of limited 
			inherent significance, to institute a regime of terror that killed millions 
			of people and changed the world.</p>

<p>The authoritarians of today are also terror managers, and if anything they are
rather more creative. Consider the current Russian regime, so admired by the
president. Vladimir Putin not only came to power in an incident that strikingly
resembled the Reichstag fire, he then used a series of terror attacks—real,
questionable, and fake—to remove obstacles to total power in Russia and to assault
democratic neighbors.</p>

<p>When Putin was appointed prime minister by a failing Boris Yeltsin in August
1999, he was an unknown with a nugatory approval rating. The following month a
series of buildings were bombed in Russian cities, apparently by the Russian secret
state police. Its officers were arrested by their own colleagues with evidence of their
guilt; in another case the speaker of the Russian parliament announced an explosion
a few days before it took place. Nonetheless, Putin declared a war of revenge
against Russia’s Muslim population in Chechnya, promising to pursue the supposed
perpetrators and “rub them out in the shithouse.”</p>

<p>The Russian nation rallied; Putin’s approval ratings skyrocketed; the following
March he won presidential elections. In 2002, after Russian security forces killed
scores of Russian civilians while suppressing a real terrorist attack at a Moscow
theater, Putin exploited the occasion to seize control of private television. After a
school in Beslan was besieged by terrorists in 2004 (in strange circumstances that
suggested a provocation), Putin did away with the position of elected regional
governors. Thus Putin’s rise to power and his elimination of two major institutions
—private television and elected regional governorships—were enabled by the
management of real, fake, and questionable terrorism.</p>

<p>After Putin returned to the presidency in 2012, Russia introduced terror
management into its foreign policy. In its invasion of Ukraine in 2014, Russia
transformed units of its own regular army into a terrorist force, removing insignia
from uniforms and denying all responsibility for the dreadful suffering they
inflicted. In the campaign for the Donbas region of southeastern Ukraine, Russia
deployed Chechen irregulars and sent units of its regular army based in Muslim
regions to join the invasion. Russia also tried (but failed) to hack the 2014
Ukrainian presidential election.</p>

<p>In April 2015, Russian hackers took over the transmission of a French
television station, pretended to be ISIS, and then broadcast material designed to
terrorize France. Russia impersonated a “cybercaliphate” so that the French would
fear terror more than they already did. The aim was presumably to drive voters to
the Far-Right National Front, a party financially supported by Russia. After 130
people were killed and 368 injured in the terrorist attack on Paris of November
2015, the founder of a think tank close to the Kremlin rejoiced that terrorism
would drive Europe toward fascism and Russia. Both fake and real Islamic
terrorism in western Europe, in other words, were thought to be in the Russian
interest.</p>

<p>In early 2016, Russia manufactured a moment of fake terror in Germany.
While bombing Syrian civilians and thus driving Muslim refugees to Europe,
Russia exploited a family drama to instruct Germans that Muslims were rapists of
children. The aim, again, seems to have been to destabilize a democratic system
and promote the parties of the extreme right.</p>

<p>The previous September, the German government had announced that it
would take half a million refugees from the war in Syria. Russia then began a
bombing campaign in Syria that targeted civilians. Having provided the refugees,
Russia then supplied the narrative. In January 2016, the Russian mass media spread
a story that a girl of Russian origin in Germany who had momentarily gone missing
had been serially raped by Muslim immigrants. With suspicious alacrity, right-wing
organizations in Germany organized protests against the government. When the
local police informed the population that no such rape had taken place, Russian
media accused them of a cover-up. Even Russian diplomats joined the spectacle.
When the American president and his national security adviser speak of
fighting terrorism alongside Russia, what they are proposing to the American
people is terror management: the exploitation of real, dubious, and simulated terror
attacks to bring down democracy. The Russian recap of the first telephone call
between the president and Vladimir Putin is telling: The two men “shared the
opinion that it is necessary to join forces against the common enemy number one:
international terrorism and extremism.”</p>

<p>For tyrants, the lesson of the Reichstag fire is that one moment of shock
enables an eternity of submission. For us, the lesson is that our natural fear and
grief must not enable the destruction of our institutions. Courage does not mean not
fearing, or not grieving. It does mean recognizing and resisting terror management
right away, from the moment of the attack, precisely when it seems most difficult to
do so.</p>

<p>James Madison nicely made the point that tyranny arises “on some favorable
emergency.” After the Reichstag fire, Hannah Arendt wrote that “I was no longer of
the opinion that one can simply be a bystander.”</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">Set a good example of what America means for the 
		    generations to come. They will need it.</p>
          <p>What is patriotism? Let us begin with what patriotism is not. It is not 
		    patriotic to dodge the draft and to mock war heroes and their families. It is 
			not patriotic to discriminate against active-duty members of the armed forces 
			in one’s companies, or to campaign to keep disabled veterans away from one’s 
			property. It is not patriotic to compare one’s search for sexual partners in 
			New York with the military service in Vietnam that one has dodged. It is not 
			patriotic to avoid paying taxes, especially when American working families do 
			pay. It is not patriotic to ask those working, taxpaying American families to 
			finance one’s own presidential campaign, and then to spend their contributions 
			in one’s own companies.</p>

<p>It is not patriotic to admire foreign dictators. It is not patriotic to cultivate a
relationship with Muammar Gaddafi; or to say that Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir
Putin are superior leaders. It is not patriotic to call upon Russia to intervene in an
American presidential election. It is not patriotic to cite Russian propaganda at
rallies. It is not patriotic to share an adviser with Russian oligarchs. It is not
patriotic to solicit foreign policy advice from someone who owns shares in a
Russian energy company. It is not patriotic to read a foreign policy speech written
by someone on the payroll of a Russian energy company. It is not patriotic to
appoint a national security adviser who has taken money from a Russian
propaganda organ. It is not patriotic to appoint as secretary of state an oilman with
Russian financial interests who is the director of a Russian-American energy
company and has received the “Order of Friendship” from Putin.
The point is not that Russia and America must be enemies. The point is that
patriotism involves serving your own country.</p>

<p>The president is a nationalist, which is not at all the same thing as a patriot. A
nationalist encourages us to be our worst, and then tells us that we are the best. A
nationalist, “although endlessly brooding on power, victory, defeat, revenge,” wrote
Orwell, tends to be “uninterested in what happens in the real world.” Nationalism is
relativist, since the only truth is the resentment we feel when we contemplate
others. As the novelist Danilo Kiš put it, nationalism “has no universal values,
aesthetic or ethical.”</p>

<p>A patriot, by contrast, wants the nation to live up to its ideals, which means
asking us to be our best selves. A patriot must be concerned with the real world,
which is the only place where his country can be loved and sustained. A patriot has
universal values, standards by which he judges his nation, always wishing it well—
and wishing that it would do better.</p>

<p>Democracy failed in Europe in the 1920s, ’30s, and ’40s, and it is failing not
only in much of Europe but in many parts of the world today. It is that history and
experience that reveals to us the dark range of our possible futures. A nationalist
will say that “it can’t happen here,” which is the first step toward disaster. A patriot
says that it could happen here, but that we will stop it.</p>

          <p class="tallFirstLetter">If none of us is prepared to die for freedom, then 
		    all of us will die under tyranny.</p>
          <p>In Shakespeare’s drama Hamlet, the hero is a virtuous man who is rightly 
		    shocked by the abrupt rise of an evil ruler. Haunted by visions, overcome by 
			nightmares, lonely and estranged, he feels that he must reconstruct his sense 
			of time. “The time is out of joint,” says Hamlet. “O cursed spite,/That ever 
			I was born to set it right!” Our time is certainly out of joint. We have 
			forgotten history for one reason and, if we are not careful, we will neglect 
			it for another. We will have to repair our own sense of time if we wish to 
			renew our commitment to liberty.</p>

<p>Until recently, we Americans had convinced ourselves that there was nothing
in the future but more of the same. The seemingly distant traumas of fascism,
Nazism, and communism seemed to be receding into irrelevance. We allowed
ourselves to accept the politics of inevitability, the sense that history could move in
only one direction: toward liberal democracy. After communism in eastern Europe
came to an end in 1989–91, we imbibed the myth of an “end of history.” In doing
so, we lowered our defenses, constrained our imagination, and opened the way for
precisely the kinds of regimes we told ourselves could never return.</p>

<p>To be sure, the politics of inevitability seem at first glance to be a kind of
history. Inevitability politicians do not deny that there is a past, a present, and a
future. They even allow for the colorful variety of the distant past. Yet they portray
the present simply as a step toward a future that we already know, one of expanding
globalization, deepening reason, and growing prosperity. This is what is called a
teleology: a narration of time that leads toward a certain, usually desirable, goal.
Communism also offered a teleology, promising an inevitable socialist utopia.
When that story was shattered a quarter century ago, we drew the wrong
conclusion: Rather than rejecting teleologies, we imagined that our own story was
true.</p>

<p>The politics of inevitability is a self-induced intellectual coma. So long as
there was a contest between communist and capitalist systems, and so long as the
memory of fascism and Nazism was alive, Americans had to pay some attention to
history and preserve the concepts that allowed them to imagine alternative futures.
Yet once we accepted the politics of inevitability, we assumed that history was no
longer relevant. If everything in the past is governed by a known tendency, then
there is no need to learn the details.</p>

<p>The acceptance of inevitability stilted the way we talked about politics in the
twenty-first century. It stifled policy debate and tended to generate party systems
where one political party defended the status quo, while the other proposed total
negation. We learned to say that there was “no alternative” to the basic order of
things, a sensibility that the Lithuanian political theorist Leonidas Donskis called
“liquid evil.” Once inevitability was taken for granted, criticism indeed became
slippery. What appeared to be critical analysis often assumed that the status quo
could not actually change, and thereby indirectly reinforced it.</p>

<p>Some spoke critically of neoliberalism, the sense that the idea of the free
market has somehow crowded out all others. This was true enough, but the very use
of the word was usually a kowtow before an unchangeable hegemony. Other critics
spoke of the need for disruption, borrowing a term from the analysis of
technological innovations. When applied to politics, it again carries the implication
that nothing can really change, that the chaos that excites us will eventually be
absorbed by a self-regulating system. The man who runs naked across a football
field certainly disrupts, but he does not change the rules of the game. The whole
notion of disruption is adolescent: It assumes that after the teenagers make a mess,
the adults will come and clean it up.</p>

<p>But there are no adults. We own this mess.</p>

<p>The second antihistorical way of considering the past is the politics of eternity. Like
the politics of inevitability, the politics of eternity performs a masquerade of
history, though a different one. It is concerned with the past, but in a self-absorbed
way, free of any real concern with facts. Its mood is a longing for past moments
that never really happened during epochs that were, in fact, disastrous. Eternity
politicians bring us the past as a vast misty courtyard of illegible monuments to
national victimhood, all of them equally distant from the present, all of them
equally accessible for manipulation. Every reference to the past seems to involve an
attack by some external enemy upon the purity of the nation.</p>

<p>National populists are eternity politicians. Their preferred reference point is
the era when democratic republics seemed vanquished and their Nazi and Soviet
rivals unstoppable: the 1930s. Those who advocated Brexit, the departure of the
United Kingdom from the European Union, imagined a British nation-state, though
such a thing never existed. There was a British Empire, and then there was Britain
as a member of the European Union. The move to separate from the EU is not a
step backward onto firm ground, but a leap into the unknown. Eerily, when judges
said that a parliamentary vote was required for Brexit, a British tabloid called them
“enemies of the people”—a Stalinist term from the show trials of the 1930s. The
National Front in France urges voters to reject Europe in the name of an imaginary
prewar French nation-state. But France, like Britain, has never existed without
either an empire or a European project. Leaders of Russia, Poland, and Hungary
alike make similar gestures toward a glowing image of the 1930s.</p>

<p>In his 2016 campaign, the American president used the slogan “America
First,” which is the name of a committee that sought to prevent the United States
from opposing Nazi Germany. The president’s strategic adviser promises policies
that will be “as exciting as the 1930s.” When exactly was the “again” in the
president’s slogan “Make America great again”? Hint: It is the same “again” that we
find in “Never again.” The president himself has described a regime change in the
style of the 1930s as the solution to the problems of the present: “You know what
solves it? When the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell and
everything is a disaster.” What we need, he thinks, are “riots to go back to where
we used to be when we were great.”</p>

<p>In the politics of eternity, the seduction by a mythicized past prevents us from
thinking about possible futures. The habit of dwelling on victimhood dulls the
impulse of self-correction. Since the nation is defined by its inherent virtue rather
than by its future potential, politics becomes a discussion of good and evil rather
than a discussion of possible solutions to real problems. Since the crisis is
permanent, the sense of emergency is always present; planning for the future seems
impossible or even disloyal. How can we even think of reform when the enemy is
always at the gate?</p>

<p>If the politics of inevitability is like a coma, the politics of eternity is like
hypnosis: We stare at the spinning vortex of cyclical myth until we fall into a trance
—and then we do something shocking at someone else’s orders.</p>

<p>The danger we now face is of a passage from the politics of inevitability to the
politics of eternity, from a naive and flawed sort of democratic republic to a
confused and cynical sort of fascist oligarchy. The politics of inevitability is terribly
vulnerable to the kind of shock it has just received. When something shatters the
myth, when our time falls out of joint, we scramble to find some other way to
organize what we experience. The path of least resistance leads directly from
inevitability to eternity. If you once believed that everything always turns out well
in the end, you can be persuaded that nothing turns out well in the end. If you once
did nothing because you thought progress is inevitable, then you can continue to do
nothing because you think time moves in repeating cycles.</p>

<p>Both of these positions, inevitability and eternity, are antihistorical. The only
thing that stands between them is history itself. History allows us to see patterns
and make judgments. It sketches for us the structures within which we can seek
freedom. It reveals moments, each one of them different, none entirely unique. To
understand one moment is to see the possibility of being the cocreator of another.
History permits us to be responsible: not for everything, but for something. The
Polish poet Czesław Miłosz thought that such a notion of responsibility worked
against loneliness and indifference. History gives us the company of those who have
done and suffered more than we have.</p>

<p>By embracing the politics of inevitability, we raised a generation without
history. How will these young Americans react now that the promise of inevitability
has been so obviously broken? Perhaps they will slide from inevitability toward
eternity. It must be hoped that they could, instead, become a historical generation,
rejecting the traps of inevitability and eternity that older generations have laid
before them. One thing is certain: If young people do not begin to make history,
politicians of eternity and inevitability will destroy it. And to make history, young
Americans will have to know some. This is not the end, but a beginning.
“The time is out of joint. O cursed spite,/That ever I was born to set it right!”
Thus Hamlet. Yet he concludes: “Nay, come, let’s go together.”</p>
